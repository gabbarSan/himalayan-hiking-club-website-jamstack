  "userTestimonialDetail": "I wanted the year to end magical and snowy... i thought it would be Europe... But I did something incredibly better TREK WITH Himalayan Hiking Club in the majestic #himalayas. As one of the  trek leaders (Vikrant Shirdade) quoted Sir Edmund \\\\\\\"you dont conquer the mountain, you conquer yourself\\\\\\\". A humbling experience that makes you grateful and tells you that the irritations one faces everyday is nothing compared to the beauty out there. Thanks Himalayan Hiking Club and specially to Saurabh for empowering me. You rock!"
